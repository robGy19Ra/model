# Agent Based Model to manipulate points in space.
A model to enable communication between several agents to manipulate a randomly generated dataset.


## Prerequisites
The model uses python and calls in several non-standard third party libraries, see below.
the agentframework.py library supplied is required to run the model.
other used python libraries inlcude:
bs4, csv, matplotlib, operator, random, requests, tkinter.


### Usage
The model can be used to manipulate a given number of agents, scraped from a web address.
random manipulation of the agents is conducted through a random number generator. Agents can be
manipulated by environmnetal factors, passed in as a .csv. Agents can also interact through
a neighbourhood analysis.
